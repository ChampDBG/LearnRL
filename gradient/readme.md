# Approximation function method
There are two parts in this fold.
* Approximation Function
  The methods for estimating the value of state with model. (maybe linear or non-linear.)

* Input Transformation
  The methods for preprocessing the input from countinuous state.
  * tile coding - [[reference](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/8/node6.html)]
  * EmECS (Embedding into Extreme points of a Convex set) - [[reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07476)]
